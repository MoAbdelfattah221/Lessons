1-Destructuring Arrays Part 1
 1-Destructuring is a javascript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays ,
     objects, and maps and set them into new , distinct variables.
     
 2-if we want to make destructing we make 
  let myFrinds = ["Mohamed" , "Waleed" , "Nabil" , "Abdelfattah"]
  let [a ,b ,c ,d] = myFrinds;
  then 
  a = Mohamed 
  b = Waleed
  c = Nabil
  d = Abdelfattah
  
Notes...
1-if we have a plus variable and his value is empty the result will be undefined
2-we can give these variables a default value.
3-if we want to escape a value we put empty --- [a, ,c]

1-Destructuring Arrays Part 2
 1- Advanced Example
 ------------------------
 let myFriends = ["Ahmed" , "Sayed" , "Ali" ,["Shady" , "Amr" , ["Mohamed" , "Gamal"]]];	
 we want to extract shady - gamal
 
 let a, b;
 [, , , [a , , [ , b]]] = myfrinds

1-Destructuring Arrays Part 3 Swapping Variables
 1-we have two ways to swapping variables 
 
 let book = "video";
 let video = "book";

 Example-one
 --------------
 let stash = video // book
 video = book;
 book = stash
 
 Example-two
 --------------
 [book , video] = [video , book];

1-Destructuring Objects Part 1
 1-we have an object and want to destruct it we make
 user{
 	theName: "Mohamed";
 	theAge: 20;
 	theCountry: "Egypt";
 }
 
 if we declare a variables we make 
 {theName, theAge, theCountry} = user
 
Notes...
1-if we want to escape a property we don't write here name.
2-if we had already declared the variables we put the destructing in a ( );
3-when we use destructing with objects we use { };
<---End Lesson 118-->




<---Start Lesson 119-->
1-Destructuring Objects Part 2
 1-we can make extract an nested object by making
 const user = {
 	theName: "Mohamed",
 	theAge: 20,
 	theCountry: "Egypt",
	skills: {
		html = 90,
		css = 97,
		bootstrap = 80,
		js = 60,
	}
 }
 
 {theName , theAge, theCountry, skills: {html , css , js}} = user
  or making
 const {html , css} = user.skills
 
Notes..
1-we can rename the variables with by  theProperty: theNewName;
Example
---------
 {theName: name, theAge: age, theCountry = "Eg"} = user
 console.log(name) // theName

2-ifw we have a property and want to extract it and it's empty , it will extract the default value look like the country

1-Destructuring Function parameters
 1-if we want to destruct a function we make 
 const user = {
 	theName: "Mohamed",
 	theAge: 20,
 	theCountry: "Egypt",
	skills: {
		html = 90,
		css = 97,
		bootstrap = 80,
		js = 60,
	}
 }
 

2-function showDetails ({theName , theAge , theCountry} = user){
	console.log(theName)
	console.log(theAge)
	console.log(theCountry)
}
